        Reading is one of my favourite things to do in my spare time. Here are a
        few books that I have read and enjoyed in the past.

              >The Martian</a
            >
            by Andy Weir. It was originally self-published by the author on his
            blog in 2011, and since then, has become a movie - which is supposed
            to be really good (according to my grade nine science teacher who
            caught me reading in class). Here is a short summary about the book:
          </p>
          <p>
            Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first people
            to walk on Mars. Now, he’s sure he’ll be the first person to die
            there. After a dust storm nearly kills him and forces his crew to
            evacuate while thinking him dead, Mark finds himself stranded and
            completely alone with no way to even signal Earth that he’s
            alive—and even if he could get word out, his supplies would be gone
            long before a rescue could arrive. Chances are, though, he won’t
            have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving
            environment, or plain-old “human error” are much more likely to kill
            him first. But Mark isn’t ready to give up yet. Drawing on his
            ingenuity, his engineering skills — and a relentless, dogged refusal
            to quit — he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable
            obstacle after the next. Will his resourcefulness be enough to
            overcome the impossible odds against him?

          by Randall Munroe. I love this book, and I love the second one even
          more. I read both of them in a weekend, and my only regret is that I
          didn't read them sooner. Here is a short summary about What If?:
          <p>
            Fans of
            <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">xkcd </a>
            ask Munroe a lot of strange questions. What if you tried to hit a
            baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? How fast can you
            hit a speed bump while driving and live? If there was a robot
            apocalypse, how long would humanity last? What if everyone only had
            one soulmate? What would happen if the moon went away? In pursuit of
            answers, Munroe ran computer simulations, pored over stacks of
            declassified military research memos, solved differential equations,
            and consulted with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are
            masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, complemented by signature xkcd
            comics. (They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind,
            or at least a really big explosion.) Far more than a book for geeks,
            What If? explains the laws of science in operation in a way that
            every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much smarter for having
            read.

            by Saci Lloyd. This book gets an honourable mention because I am
            reading it right now. It isn't THAT good, so I won't include a
            summary about the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of today, I have finished the book, and let me just tell you, it
            is horrible. In concept, the book would've been good, but the author
            butchered the book. Her writing style didn't match the "vibe" of the
            book.

        Lyrebirds because they are smarter than they are pretty - and they are
        stunning. They are extremely good expert mimics and are able to copy
        both natural and mechanical sounds. Sounds like other birds, chainsaws,
        car engines and barking dogs!
      </p>
      <p>
        I just like platypuses because they make no sense what-so-ever. Like how
        did evolution cause egg-laying venomous mammals that glow under UV light
        (we don't even know why They do) to exist. They literaly use electronic
        impulses to detect underwater prey and locate objects in water. THEY USE
        ELECTRICITY TO HUNT! How cool/weird is that?

        I'll be honset with you, I wasn't sure what to put as my third favourite

        say "that isn't a color". Sooo... Yes. I like
